## Warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Read the entire guide before starting. Make sure you understand all of what you're going to do!
- If you see a warning and/or error during the process, it is not normal. Contact us on telegram if you see anything odd, but do not continue or proceed on your own, you will break things further.
- Don't rerun the commands if you interrupt the process. You may break things. 
- Do not run all commands at once.
- Do not commit *any* typo with *any* commands. 
- Be familiar with command line interfaces. 
- When using TWRP, it is normal and expected for the phone to be detected as a Xiaomi phone and for touch to not work.

## Getting your current boot slot (A/B)

Assuming your Surface Duo is booted to Android‚Ñ¢, plugged into to your PC:

```
adb reboot bootloader
```

Your Surface Duo will reboot into fastboot. Once you're there:

```
fastboot getvar current-slot
```

A line with the text 'current-slot:' will appear.
The value can be a or b.

Take note of your slot, we'll need that later.

For the rest of this guide we'll pretend we need to extract the `boot` partition and that our current slot is `b`.

Next, we boot into TWRP.

```
fastboot boot surfaceduo1-twrp.img
```

Wait until TWRP finishes loading. Friendly reminder that touch still doesn't work in TWRP.

Now we'll need to find the location of our boot partition, as it is different for each device.

On the command prompt:

```
adb shell
```

This will open a shell on our device and show its output on our PC. 

```
ls /dev/block/platform/soc/
```

If you're lucky, you'll get only one line of output:

Take note of all the lines that get output from this command. In my case, it's only one and it is `1d84000.ufshc`.

Back into the shell:

```
ls -al /dev/block/platform/soc/[the last line we took note of]/by-name/
```

*In my case the command will be: `ls -al /dev/block/platform/soc/1d84000.ufshc/by-name/`*

This is going to output a lot of lines, with each partition name having its mount point. Look for the line that says `boot_[your slot]`:

Now let's take note of its mount point, in my case: `/dev/block/sde26`.

Let's make an image of the partition:

```
dd if=/dev/block/[your mount point] of=/tmp/boot.img
```
*In my case, the command will be: `dd if=/dev/block/sde26 of=/tmp/boot.img`.*

Now let's exit the shell and extract the boot.img from the device:

```
exit

adb pull /tmp/boot.img
```

We're done! ü•≥üéà
