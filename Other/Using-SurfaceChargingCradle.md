# Using the Surface Charging Cradle

## Trivia

The Surface Charging Cradle originally came bundled with the Surface Slim Pen (1st Gen) and is required to charge up a Surface Slim Pen (1st Gen) or Surface Slim Pen 2 Pen.

## Firmware Update and Charging Issues with Surface Slim Pen 2

For Surface Charging Cradles purchased separately before 2021 or the ones bundled with the Surface Slim Pen (1st Gen), a firmware update is required in order to be able to charge a Surface Slim Pen 2.

When the Charging Cradle detects an unknown pen, it will repeatedly blink white and red, indicating the firmware on the charging cradle is unable to communicate to the pen put in the cradle.

The Windows Drivers for Surface Duo devices bundles the required firmware update packages as well as support drivers to update and communicate with the charging cradle.

In order to update the firmware on your charging cradle, simply plug it in using an USB-C to USB-C cable to your Surface Duo, and wait a few seconds, then remove and put back your pen, and the pen should charge.

## Surface Charging Cradle Extra features

The Surface Charging cradle is identical to the hardware built right into Surface Type Covers with pen housing. This means that the cradle is able to automatically pair any pen in it to the device, wake up the device when the pen gets removed, and even trigger the inking flyout whenever your pen is removed from the cradle.
