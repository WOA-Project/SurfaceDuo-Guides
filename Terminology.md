## Official File Packages

### BMR

Bare Metal Recovery, also refered to incorrectly by Microsoft as a *Recovery Package* in the case of Surface Duo. These zip files are obtained primarly from https://aka.ms/sri, and only allow reflashing the Android Partition. They cannot be used to fix any issue that doesn't relate to modifying Android partition content such as a modified partition table or Windows being installed. Sideloading/Flashing those will never remove Windows, nor fix any partition layout kind of issues.
