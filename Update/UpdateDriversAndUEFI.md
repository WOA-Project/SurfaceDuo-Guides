![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/ab36aa10-6617-4680-ac06-bb58b7a0c3bb)

- Go to the folder where you extracted the Google Android‚Ñ¢ Platform tools using the CD command and the path of the folder, like so:

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/24760f21-dc1b-48e6-9ae3-0aeb16f8953c)

- Run the following command to ensure your phone is detected by your PC

```batch
adb devices
```

> [!TIP]
> If you see no device listed, check for updates in Windows Update, you likely have a Driver Update pending so the phone is recognized, when you're good to go, you should see the following image below this notice.
> It is possible certain computers see no update offered (like Windows ARM64 Computers or other older machines with no functional Windows Update). If this is your case, we also provide Drivers for you to download
> at the following location, you will have to install them using Device Manager on your PC. [Download USB Drivers](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/raw/main/Files/USB-Drivers.zip)

- Run the following command now

```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```

You will be rebooted to Surface Duo's bootloader.

## Booting to TWRP

- Start by booting TWRP:

For Surface Duo (1st Gen):

- Plug your phone to your PC, open a command prompt and start by typing the following text, but do not press enter just yet

```batch
fastboot boot
```

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/24c5ed51-4710-449d-a5dc-686f8da8ea47)

- Go find the surfaceduo1-twrp.img file you downloaded earlier, right click it, click "Copy as path"

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/3e8db3d5-44d0-4e6c-a7ef-674f86e82650)

- Then go back to the Command Prompt window we started writing text in previously, and simply, right click on it with your mouse (or long press if you're on a touch device), you should now see this:

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/e97d514b-a314-4faf-9622-75bdab066985)

- Now you can press enter

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/2e27f24c-5b12-476d-99d8-f11de5baa807)

You will now boot to TWRP. Reminder that touch doesn't work on TWRP for now, so you'll have to work through your PC.

For Surface Duo 2:

- Plug your phone to your PC, open a command prompt and start by typing the following text, but do not press enter just yet

```batch
fastboot boot
```

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/24c5ed51-4710-449d-a5dc-686f8da8ea47)

- Go find the surfaceduo2-twrp.img file you downloaded earlier, right click it, click "Copy as path"

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/3e8db3d5-44d0-4e6c-a7ef-674f86e82650)

- Then go back to the Command Prompt window we started writing text in previously, and simply, right click on it with your mouse (or long press if you're on a touch device), you should now see this:

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/e97d514b-a314-4faf-9622-75bdab066985)

- Now you can press enter

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/2e27f24c-5b12-476d-99d8-f11de5baa807)

You will now boot to TWRP. Reminder that touch doesn't work on TWRP for now, so you'll have to work through your PC.

---

## Switching to Mass Storage Mode

- Once inside TWRP, touch will not be working and the device will say it is locked. This is completely normal. Keep the phone plugged to your PC and do these commands ONE BY ONE WITH NO TYPO!:

```batch
adb shell "setenforce 0"
adb push <path to downloaded msc.tar> /sdcard/
adb shell "tar -xf /sdcard/msc.tar -C /sdcard --no-same-owner"
adb shell "sh /sdcard/msc.sh"
```

## Updating Drivers

> [!WARNING]
> From now on we will assume X: is the Win partition for all commands. Replace them correctly with what you previously picked or you will lose data on your PC.

- Download the latest driver package from https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Releases/releases/latest

Note: Here's a table of what to download if you're a bit lost:

| File Name                                      | Target Device         |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| SurfaceDuo-Drivers-XXXX.XX-Desktop-Epsilon.zip | Surface Duo (1st Gen) |
| SurfaceDuo-Drivers-XXXX.XX-Desktop-Zeta.zip    | Surface Duo 2         |

- Extract the driver package, and go to the folder where you extracted it.

- Double click the ```OfflineUpdater.cmd``` file.

- Accept the User Account Control warning when prompted

- Enter the drive letter of the connected phone in mass storage, as we previously mentioned, for us it's currently ```X:```, but it may very well be different for you. In our example, we enter ```X:``` and then press enter.

- The process may take a while, once it is done, you will be prompted to press any key, press enter when that's the case.

Congratulations, you just updated your drivers!

- You can now reboot your phone using:

```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```

You will be back into Surface Duo's bootloader.

_Image of what you should see right now: Surface Duo in Bootloader mode_

## Updating UEFI

Simply use the latest UEFI image

- Assuming you are in Surface Duo's bootloader, run the following command to boot into Windows:

```batch
fastboot boot uefi.img
```

> [!TIP]
> You can setup dual boot again if you need it by using the latest UEFI files and following the dual boot guide again (in case of a manual file creation), or by flashing one of the prebuilt dual boot images (see UEFI release notes for more details on both).
