## Disclaimers

> [!WARNING]
> - Don't create partitions from Mass Storage Mode on Windows (because ABL will break with blank/spaces in names), your phone may be irrecoverable otherwise
> - If you see a warning and/or error during the process, it is not normal. Contact us on telegram if you see anything odd, but do not continue or proceed on your own, you will break things further.
> - Don't rerun the commands if you interrupt the process. You may break your partition table. Parted is a very *delicate* tool, anything you do may cause permanent damage to your device.
> - Do not run all commands at once. Parted is a very *delicate* tool, anything you do may cause permanent damage to your device.
> - Do not commit *any* typo with *any* commands. Parted is a very *delicate* tool, anything you do may cause permanent damage to your device.
> - Be familiar with command line interfaces. Parted is a very *delicate* tool, anything you do may cause permanent damage to your device.
> - When using TWRP, it is normal and expected for the phone to be detected as an Asus phone and for touch to not work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **THIS WILL WIPE ALL YOUR ANDROID‚Ñ¢ DATA**
>
> We don't take any responsibility for any damage done to your phone. By following this guide, you agree to take full responsibility of your actions. We have done some testing,
>

**PLEASE READ AND BE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THE ENTIRE GUIDE BEFORE STARTING**

## What you will get üõí

You will end up with both Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows on your Surface Duo. Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows will both split the internal storage (64GB and 64GB or 128GB and 128GB or 256GB and 256GB).

Android‚Ñ¢ will boot normally, and you will have to use a PC to boot Windows when needed, unless you create a dual boot image (explained later).

# Steps üõ†Ô∏è

## Acquiring all files

<details>
    <summary>Here's how to acquire the Android SDK Platform Tools: <b>Click to expand</b></summary>
    <p>


First, start by going to the [Android Platform SDK download page](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) on your computer.

![SDK-1-Top](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/4c1c3762-24d8-4150-ac69-670738eb62c1)

Once on the page, scroll a little bit down til you see the link to download the platform tools for Windows.

![SDK-2-Mid](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/cd14a232-4995-480f-a061-54507e83cf41)

Click on it, an EULA will open like below:

![SDK-3-EULA](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/16d6b7df-ab56-414c-b1a5-561ec6b3ae4e)

Scroll all the way down (after reading it if that's your thing)

![SDK-4-EULA-Bottom](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/1368b2b0-74b8-4a7c-9aff-df2ca25c2f42)

Tick "I have read and agree to above terms conditions"

![SDK-5-EULA-TICK (alt)](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/02905fa2-64b8-426b-b42f-c1bb88eaa88a)

And click download

![SDK-5-EULA-TICK](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/0983f27a-76e7-4fda-ac4d-adaa56702e90)

Save the file on your computer, and extract the zip file by opening it, and selecting extract all.

![SDK-6-DL](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/adc1bba0-6118-418e-9005-e2db12860893)

  </p>
</details>

## Going to the Bootloader menu

- Start by turning on your Surface Duo into Android‚Ñ¢, and unlock it

- Open a command prompt on your PC

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/ab36aa10-6617-4680-ac06-bb58b7a0c3bb)

- Go to the folder where you extracted the Google Android‚Ñ¢ Platform tools using the CD command and the path of the folder, like so:

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/24760f21-dc1b-48e6-9ae3-0aeb16f8953c)

- Run the following command to ensure your phone is detected by your PC

```batch
adb devices
```

> [!TIP]
> If you see no device listed, check for updates in Windows Update, you likely have a Driver Update pending so the phone is recognized, when you're good to go, you should see the following image below this notice.
> It is possible certain computers see no update offered (like Windows ARM64 Computers or other older machines with no functional Windows Update). If this is your case, we also provide Drivers for you to download
> at the following location, you will have to install them using Device Manager on your PC. [Download USB Drivers](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/raw/main/Files/USB-Drivers.zip)

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/b3a8b091-1b34-47e4-bd6e-c286ee808f14)

- Run the following command now

```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```

You will be rebooted to Surface Duo's bootloader.

_Image of what you should see right now: Surface Duo in Bootloader mode_

## Booting to TWRP

- Plug your phone to your PC, open a command prompt and start by typing the following text, but do not press enter just yet

```batch
fastboot boot
```

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/24c5ed51-4710-449d-a5dc-686f8da8ea47)

- Go find the surfaceduo2-twrp.img file you downloaded earlier, right click it, click "Copy as path"

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/3e8db3d5-44d0-4e6c-a7ef-674f86e82650)

- Then go back to the Command Prompt window we started writing text in previously, and simply, right click on it with your mouse (or long press if you're on a touch device), you should now see this:

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/e97d514b-a314-4faf-9622-75bdab066985)

- Now you can press enter

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/2e27f24c-5b12-476d-99d8-f11de5baa807)

You will now boot to TWRP. Touch will not be working and the device will say it is locked. This is completely normal. Keep the phone plugged to your PC and continue along.

## Preparing TWRP

- Once booted into TWRP, start by running the following command to make sure everything we do is accepted by the device:

```batch
adb shell "setenforce 0"
```

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/80cd7c2f-e6e0-4078-9445-3fe245c5d0ca)

- Now, let's copy parted onto the device, first, start by typing the following text, but do not press enter just yet

```batch
adb push
```

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/e318851b-aac0-460b-be26-d5d40f4dfb67)

- Go find the parted file you downloaded earlier, right click it, click "Copy as path"

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/947f8fc2-4d55-4fad-8507-615e8257b537)

- Then go back to the Command Prompt window we started writing text in previously, and simply, right click on it with your mouse (or long press if you're on a touch device), you should now see this:

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/d422e848-fbcc-4871-85b2-db64b3347cf3)

- And now, continue to write the rest of the command, like so:

```batch
 /sdcard/
```

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/75736db7-475f-4c3d-94af-d7d3ac5e3b5a)

- Now you can press enter

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/fe732f9b-d5fd-4049-863b-047a94013e31)

- Now let's install parted correctly onto the TWRP image, by running the following command

```batch
adb shell "mv /sdcard/parted /sbin/parted && chmod 755 /sbin/parted"
```

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/787b7ae3-8fdf-43cd-9d06-341c5615f930)

- Now, let's install some support files we'll need:

```batch
adb push <path to downloaded surfaceduo2-twrp-fssupport.tar> /sdcard/
adb shell "tar -xf /sdcard/surfaceduo2-twrp-fssupport.tar -C /sdcard/fssupport --no-same-owner"
adb shell "chmod 755 /sdcard/fssupport/*"
adb shell "mv /sdcard/fssupport/* /sbin/"
```

- Now, let's open a shell onto the device, by running the following command

```batch
adb shell
```

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/972acc7b-6d28-40eb-883e-81c70cf9ad43)

- Now we are issuing commands directly from inside Surface Duo using the PC.

## Making the partitions

AFTER. RUNNING. ANY. SINGLE. ONE. OF. THEM. ONCE. You can rerun them __only__ if you completed the installation, and followed the uninstall guide, never if you messed up anything, or didn't proceed with the uninstall guide yet.
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you end up messing up, or "forgetting" to run a command, DO NOT RERUN ANYTHING. CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY ON TELEGRAM. EXPLAIN WHAT YOU DID. POST A SCREENSHOT OF THE "print" PARTED COMMAND OUTPUT DONE LAST TO KNOW THE CURRENT STATUS AND NOT THE ONE PRIOR TO 20 OTHER COMMANDS.

---

- Let's run parted and make the partitions (ONE BY ONE WITH NO TYPO!):

```bash
setenforce 0
parted /dev/block/sda
print
```

**Make sure that the last partition listed is numbered 8. If it is not, below's commands may DESTROY your phone in a permanent manner**

Take note of original sizing, here it was 401MB -> 110GB (256GB variant: 401MB -> XXXGB TODO (Please file an issue so we know!)) (512GB variant: 401MB -> XXXGB TODO (Please file an issue so we know!)) and replace every occurence of 401MB and 110GB with your original sizing that *you noted down* (these may not differ, but if they do, replace them)

This will get you out of parted.

We have deleted partition 8, which was the Android‚Ñ¢ userdata partition, and created 3 partitions: an esp partition which will contain the Windows boot files,
a win partition that will have Windows, and the last one is the new userdata partition for Android‚Ñ¢, just smaller.

Now let's make these partitions actually usable:

```bash
setenforce 0
mkfs.fat -F32 -s1 /dev/block/sda8
mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/block/sda9
mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/block/sda10
exit
```

### End of the Dangerous section

<details>
  <summary>Additional Context and Notes</Summary>
  <p>

If you somehow break entirely your partition table, you might be interested in the original offsets of each partition in order to fix it.

```bash
mkpart ssd 6s 7s
mkpart persist 8s 8199s
mkpart metadata 8200s 12295s
mkpart frp 12296s 12423s
mkpart misc 12424s 12679s
mkpart rawdump 12680s 89479s
mkpart vm-data 89480s 97835s
```

The offsets are valid for both the Surface Duo 2 128GB model, and the Surface Duo 2 256GB model, and the Surface Duo 2 512GB model. They do not include userdata. You will have to recreate this yourself.

(NEVER RUN THESE COMMANDS IF YOU DO NOT NEED TO OR YOU ALREADY PARTITIONS IN PLACE, ADVANCED USERS ONLY, YOU MAY KILL YOUR PHONE HERE)
