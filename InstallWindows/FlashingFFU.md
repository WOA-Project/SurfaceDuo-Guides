## What you will get üõí

You will end up with both Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows on your Surface Duo. Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows will both split the internal storage.

Android‚Ñ¢ will boot normally, and you will have to use a PC to boot Windows when needed, unless you create a dual boot image (explained later).

# Steps üõ†Ô∏è

## Unlocking the Bootloader

If not already done, please first proceed with the [Unlocking the Bootloader](UnlockingBootloader.md) guide for Surface Duo. Come back once you're done. If you already followed this guide, please skip the unlocking section.

Congratulations, you successfully installed WOA Device Manager.

## Getting to FFU Loader

| Steps | Illustration |
|-|-|
| Plug your device into your computer inside Android‚Ñ¢ | <img align="right" width="425" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-22 183159" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/001215d0-4bbb-4ba1-839c-552890fbc1b7"> |
| Go into the Switch Mode Section of WOA Device Manager | <img align="right" width="425" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-22 183227" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/95732dc8-10c5-472f-b6ca-89c9ba8f0563"> |
| Click Switch to Windows mode | <img align="right" width="425" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-22 183235" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/805dc2cc-0db2-472a-9f6d-7597b4336e77"> |
| When the device shows the Rainbow color bars on its screen, Press the Volume Down Key on the side of your device til you see something like shown below on screen: | <img align="right" width="425" alt="Surface Duo in FFU Loader mode" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/f35ba53d-70c6-41de-9cca-ad31368a35fb"> |
| WOA Device Manager will detect your device in UFP mode | <img align="right" width="425" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-22 183302" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/90c5d4a3-4b37-4486-8920-8b0e14e0b461"> |

> [!TIP]
> In case the PC complains the device was not found, try using an USB-2 port or cable that downgrades your connection to USB-2, there are known issues with the UEFI that prevent USB-3 from functioning properly at the moment, and will be addressed in a future update.

Congratulations, you're now in FFU Loader.

## Flashing the Windows FFU Image

| Steps | Illustration |
|-|-|
| Go to the Flash Section of WOA Device Manager | <img align="right" width="425" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-22 183326" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/6773ecbb-0de3-4cd4-9aa3-76ac02d7a273"> |
| Pick your FFU File, and click "Flash FFU Image" | <img align="right" width="425" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-22 183344" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/b6fd0499-0c34-410c-9e2d-25b331b7a2be"> |
| You should now see the device flashing on both your computer and on the device, wait til the process is complete. | <p float="left"> <img width="45%" alt="Surface Duo in FFU Loader mode, flashing" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/a0d8af6c-5b30-4afd-85d3-58249accde12"> <img width="45%" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-22 183429" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/171d458f-5c89-4af8-86fd-06bfb59d4dd0"> </p> |
| Wait til the process is finished, and you should be back into Android‚Ñ¢ or a boot failure screen. | |

> [!TIP]
> If you are seeing a boot failure option, see below section entitled "Reset Android‚Ñ¢"

## Reset Android‚Ñ¢

If this is your first time flashing this FFU file, or you're flashing a different storage or layout configuration image, you will lose all of your Android‚Ñ¢ data. Further more, you will also not have Android boot successfully.
If this isn't your case, feel free to ignore this section, Android‚Ñ¢ should still boot fine.
If this is your case, when booting Android‚Ñ¢, you will get notified Android cannot boot anymore. In this screen, you must select "Factory Reset" instead of "Try again" or else, Android‚Ñ¢ will refuse to boot again.

You should now be seeing the Android‚Ñ¢ Out of Box Experience (OOBE).

| Now go to the System section, you should see a new Developer options section like shown below | <img align="right" width="425" alt="A7 Android‚Ñ¢ - Settings System with Dev" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/a2de44f2-b492-450a-830a-5e7141e232b7"> |

## Boot Windows üöÄ

We are ready to boot for the first time!

| Steps | Illustration |
|-|-|
| Inside WOA Device Manager, go to switch mode | <img align="right" width="425" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-22 183227" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/a5fb15b1-6a43-45b5-b440-df243b076b9c"> |
| and select "Switch to Windows". | <img align="right" width="425" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-22 183235" src="https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/bb4f618a-fa7c-4874-8dd6-f87181753be6"> | 

This step above will be needed every time you will want to boot Windows and needs to be done from the Bootloader mode.

If you did everything right, Windows will now boot! Enjoy!

Let Windows set itself up, and come back once you're on the Windows Desktop on your Surface Duo

> [!NOTE]
> If the Touch keyboard won't show up in OOBE, touch somewhere else (to let the text box loose focus) and then touch into the text box again. As an alternative, you can use the On-Screen Keyboard.

> [!NOTE]
> If you get a BSOD (bugcheck screen) during initial setup, you can try erasing both the esp and win partitions using "fastboot erase esp" and "fastboot erase win", and reflash the FFU file, then it should work. This issue will get fixed in later FFU revisions.

## Boot Windows again after initial installation

You'll have two methods of booting Windows.

- Manual booting with a PC
    - Pros: You can freely update Android‚Ñ¢
    - Cons: You will need a PC to boot to Windows

- Enabling Dual Boot
    - Pros: You'll be able to boot Windows directly from the device
    - Cons: Every time you update Android‚Ñ¢, you'll have to follow [this guide](/InstallWindows/DualBoot.md)

In case you want the dual boot option, then follow [this guide](/InstallWindows/DualBoot.md)
