## What you will get üõí

You will end up with both Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows on your Surface Duo. Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows will both split the internal storage.

Android‚Ñ¢ will boot normally, and you will have to use a PC to boot Windows when needed, unless you create a dual boot image (explained later).

# Steps üõ†Ô∏è

## Unlocking the Bootloader

If not already done, please first proceed with the [Unlocking the Bootloader](UnlockingBootloader.md) guide for Surface Duo. Come back once you're done. If you already followed this guide, please skip the unlocking section.

## Acquiring all files

    <summary>Here's how to acquire the Android SDK Platform Tools: <b>Click to expand</b></summary>
    <p>


First, start by going to the [Android Platform SDK download page](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) on your computer.

![SDK-1-Top](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/4c1c3762-24d8-4150-ac69-670738eb62c1)

Once on the page, scroll a little bit down til you see the link to download the platform tools for Windows.

![SDK-2-Mid](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/cd14a232-4995-480f-a061-54507e83cf41)

Click on it, an EULA will open like below:

![SDK-3-EULA](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/16d6b7df-ab56-414c-b1a5-561ec6b3ae4e)

Scroll all the way down (after reading it if that's your thing)

![SDK-4-EULA-Bottom](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/1368b2b0-74b8-4a7c-9aff-df2ca25c2f42)

Tick "I have read and agree to above terms conditions"

![SDK-5-EULA-TICK (alt)](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/02905fa2-64b8-426b-b42f-c1bb88eaa88a)

And click download

![SDK-5-EULA-TICK](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/0983f27a-76e7-4fda-ac4d-adaa56702e90)

![SDK-6-DL](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/adc1bba0-6118-418e-9005-e2db12860893)

  </p>
</details>

## Getting to FFU Loader

- Reboot into the Bootloader mode by running this command while inside Android‚Ñ¢:

```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```

![Surface Duo in Bootloader mode](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/eb19d500-4849-4ded-bd0c-894e4ac56486)
_Image of what you should see right now: Surface Duo in Bootloader mode_

- Start by booting the UEFI:

```batch
fastboot boot uefi.img
```

- Press the Volume Down Key on the side of your device til you see something like shown below on screen:

![Surface Duo in FFU Loader mode](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/f35ba53d-70c6-41de-9cca-ad31368a35fb)

Congratulations, you're now in FFU Loader.

## Flashing the Windows FFU Image

- Open a command prompt where you extracted the FFU-Loader-Tools archive, and run the following commands:

```batch
ImageUtility.exe FlashDevice -Path <Path to the FFU File you downloaded>
```

![Surface Duo in FFU Loader mode, flashing](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/7770ef0a-62d9-49de-a9b0-f8e4f3a58933)

- You should now see the device flashing on both your computer and on the device, wait til the process is complete. In case the PC complains the device was not found, try using an USB-2 port or cable that downgrades your connection to USB-2, there are known issues with the UEFI that prevent USB-3 from functioning properly at the moment, and will be addressed in a future update.

- Once done you should be seeing the following screen:

![Surface Duo in FFU Loader mode, flashed](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/ba3c33df-9eb5-4b21-90da-7b8b0c3a5faf)

- Now reboot the device, you should be back to the bootloader menu:

```batch
ImageUtility.exe RebootDevice
```

- In case the bootloader menu does not automatically come up, press the volume down when running above command to be 100% sure you go into the bootloader menu.

- Run the following two commands:

```batch
fastboot set_active other
fastboot set_active other
```

And reboot your device
```batch
fastboot reboot
```

## Reset Android‚Ñ¢

If this is your first time flashing this FFU file, or you're flashing a different storage or layout configuration image, you will lose all of your Android‚Ñ¢ data. Further more, you will also not have Android boot successfully.
If this isn't your case, feel free to ignore this section, Android‚Ñ¢ should still boot fine.
If this is your case, when booting Android‚Ñ¢, you will get notified Android cannot boot anymore. In this screen, you must select "Factory Reset" instead of "Try again" or else, Android‚Ñ¢ will refuse to boot again.

- You should now be seeing the Android‚Ñ¢ Out of Box Experience (OOBE). Setup your phone to confirm it works correctly.

![Android‚Ñ¢ - OOBE](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/5f86cbbe-df08-4ba6-92aa-b7fd2a7f72b3)

- Assuming your Surface Duo is booted to Android‚Ñ¢, plugged to your PC

- Using the Microsoft Launcher, find the settings app

![A1 Android‚Ñ¢ - Open Settings](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/36ef925c-fe98-4ec6-9861-c1037d8ced19)

- Open the Android‚Ñ¢ Settings app

![A2 Android‚Ñ¢ - Settings Opened](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/02b78630-d2b2-4211-abe1-c89255fe9bc6)

- Scroll down to the about section, and open it

![A3 Android‚Ñ¢ - Settings About](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/0dad0ac3-21f3-42fd-a02c-78e9eb399118)

- Scroll all the way down til you see the Build Number field

![A4 Android‚Ñ¢ - Settings About Down](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/afac2404-9624-4298-9785-b6a21bc31699)

- Press the Build number field 7 times consecutively, you should first start to see a popup after 3 taps

![A5 Android‚Ñ¢ - Settings About Down Tap Dev](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/b850bef7-2938-47a0-b781-c54178e3cf7d)

- Once done tapping 7 times, you should be seeing this popup instead

![A6 Android‚Ñ¢ - Settings About Down Tap Dev Done](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/8afef456-00a4-41e7-9653-c91a901e16c1)

- Now go to the System section, you should see a new Developer options section like shown below

![A7 Android‚Ñ¢ - Settings System with Dev](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/a2de44f2-b492-450a-830a-5e7141e232b7)

- Scroll all the way down til you see the "USB debugging" option

![Android‚Ñ¢ Settings - Dev - Debugging Option](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/3847fdcb-c19c-4c5d-aa4c-00a60e85c2b0)

- And turn on the "USB debugging" option

![Android‚Ñ¢ Settings - Dev - Debugging Option Confirmation](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/60b52b98-8c6a-4845-833d-470378206fb2)

- Reboot into the Bootloader mode by running this command while inside Android‚Ñ¢:

```batch

## Boot Windows üöÄ

We are ready to boot for the first time!

Let's boot the UEFI, from a command prompt:

```batch
fastboot boot uefi.img
```

This step above will be needed every time you will want to boot Windows and needs to be done from the Bootloader mode.

If you did everything right, Windows will now boot! Enjoy!

**Note:** If the Touch keyboard won't show up in OOBE, touch somewhere else (to let the text box loose focus) and then touch into the text box again. As an alternative, you can use the On-Screen Keyboard.

Let Windows set itself up, and come back once you're on the Windows Desktop on your Surface Duo

**Note 2:** If you get a BSOD (bugcheck screen) during initial setup, you can try erasing both the esp and win partitions using "fastboot erase esp" and "fastboot erase win", and reflash the FFU file, then it should work. This issue will get fixed in later FFU revisions.

## Boot Windows again after initial installation

You'll have two methods of booting Windows.

- Manual booting with a PC
    - Pros: You can freely update Android‚Ñ¢
    - Cons: You will need a PC to boot to Windows

- Enabling Dual Boot
    - Pros: You'll be able to boot Windows directly from the device
    - Cons: Every time you update Android‚Ñ¢, you'll have to follow [this guide](/InstallWindows/DualBoot.md)

In case you want the dual boot option, then follow [this guide](/InstallWindows/DualBoot.md)
