## What you will get 🛒

You will end up with both Android™ and Windows on your Surface Duo. Android™ and Windows will both split the internal storage (64GB and 64GB or 128GB and 128GB).

Android™ will boot normally, and you will have to use a PC to boot Windows when needed, unless you create a dual boot image (explained later).

> It is possible certain computers see no update offered (like Windows ARM64 Computers or other older machines with no functional Windows Update). If this is your case, we also provide Drivers for you to download
> at the following location, you will have to install them using Device Manager on your PC. [Download USB Drivers](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/raw/main/InstallWindows/Files/USB-Drivers.zip)
