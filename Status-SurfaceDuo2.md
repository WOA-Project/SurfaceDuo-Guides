## Surface Duo 2

### Keep up with the development in real time

Most updates are given first and foremost via our dedicated Announcement Telegram Channel. We try our best to also announce things elsewhere, but telegram remains our primary way of interfacing with the community at the moment. You can find the channel at https://t.me/DuoWOA_Announcements

### Notes about the Development Schedule

__Note: This note is provided for informational purposes only, it does not in any way represent any commitment from any entity working towards the development of the Windows port on Surface Duo and does not mean that all functionality will be available or the development will ever finish, you should not buy the device for the sole purpose of using Windows on it with hopes of it eventually being fully functional or having XYZ hardware feature working in the supposed future. What is available today is what should be considered as the most you can get. Purchase with this in mind, and don't assume we will get everything working. We may, but don't impulse buy with this thought. In either case, we cannot be taken responsible nor accountable for functionality we never promised to you. The device is sold as a fully working Android™ Device, not fully working Windows device from Microsoft.__

The development for the Windows Port is currently scheduled as follows:

- ~~Milestone #0: Early UEFI/OS bring up, proof of concept~~ Completed!
- Milestone #1: SoC hardware bringup in Windows OS, end goal is to have all hardware blocks/components of the SoC in a functional or communicating state by the end of the milestone, but not have it interface with the OS if it isn't already done. **In progress!**
- Milestone #2: Bug fixes, this is where we will fix major issues like crashes, etc
- Milestone #3: Calibration/Tuning, calibrate everything to work as it should be.
- Milestone #4: To be defined?

_No ETA will be provided for **any** of these development phases_
